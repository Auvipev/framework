## About this framework
Started as project for learn and master PHP, Linna framework turned into a simple and elegant toolset for build web application.
<br/><br/> 
The development of Framework is done trying to get PHP best pratices always in mind. 
Code was fully commented, ready for [phpDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org/) and 
is written applying the five [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) principles.<br/><br/>
If you wish deepen PHP best pratices you can start from [phptherightway](http://www.phptherightway.com/).
<br/><br/>
At moment, code, isn't utilized in production environment, I hope in future, to use it for develop a new app as replacement of my actual (and very old) personnel management web application.
